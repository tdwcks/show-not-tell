#### Story + Sensor = Collection

This process grounds every collection in the context of the news cycle. We’re always constrained by the sensors and frameworks which come with your phone so we have to find a story with potential to work with something your iPhone is already measuring in order to create a collection. 

In yesterday’s Guardian there was a story about the Junior Doctors striking over new contracts being imposed on them. “Strikes ‘increasingly hard to justify’ - GMC head”. Junior doctors obviously work very hard, so it might be interesting to measure whether or not they’re getting enough sleep. 

We know that the iPhone can measure how much sleep we get each night so this might be an interesting starting point for a collection.
